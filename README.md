# SilenceMap-Adaptation-and-Extensions
SilenceMap-Adaptation-and-Extensions replicates and extends the [SilenceMap framework](https://github.com/Chamanzar/SilenceMap/tree/v1.0) for EEG-based BCI applications. It includes notebooks for motor adaptation integration, EEG preprocessing, SSVEP analysis, and testing novel methods like WAVEFRONT and CSD-STGAT for improving neural decoding performance.
